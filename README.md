# Gun Related Deaths Analysis (Python)
This project involves the analysis of gun-related deaths data using supervised learning techniques, particularly Naive Bayes, to predict trends and patterns in gun-related deaths.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (SKLearn)

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, you can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jon-Best-SWE/Gun-Related-Deaths-Analysis.git
cd Gun-Related-Deaths-Analysis
```

2. Analyze the Data
The Python script provided in this repository (`Jon_Best_Gun_Related_Deaths_Supervised_Learning_Code.py`) contains code for analyzing the gun related deaths dataset. It is not meant to be run directly from the command line but should be executed within a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Open in a Python Environment
You can open and run the provided Python scripts in a Python IDE (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook) or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

4. Run the Code
Inside your Python environment, you can execute the code within these scripts to perform the analysis.

5. View the Results
The results and visualizations will be displayed within your Python environment.

Please note that these scripts are designed for data analysis and should not be run as standalone command-line applications.
